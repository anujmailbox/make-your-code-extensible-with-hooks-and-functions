# [Make Your Code Extensible with Hooks and Functions][published url]
## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]


WordPress themes and plugins are more flexible, and easier for other developers to add to, if they're built in a way which is extensible. Hooks are a way to allow the rest of WordPress to connect to functions in your plugin or theme at specific times. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Rachel McCollin will teach you how to use action hooks and filter hooks to make it easy for yourself or others to customize your themes and plugins.
